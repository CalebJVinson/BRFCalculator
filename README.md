# BRFCalculator

![alt text](brf_3dplot.png)

This project was a continuation and refinement of a file I worked on for my first project in python. The main changes were in creating a class of functions and expanding the range of possible types following a course in game theory. Our primary text was *Game Theory for Applied Economists* by Robert Gibbons. The models cover topics in Chapters 1, 3, and 4. Some of the dynamic games were not covered as much in this second version, but I am working on adding to the class of functions as time continues. Additionally, some of this information tied into a course in Industrial Organization and Competition Economics.
